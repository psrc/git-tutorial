## Merge Conflicts

When do you encounter merge conflicts?

--

**.green[When things diverge and two people have changed the same lines in a file.]**

--
.pull-left.center[
`r ji('smiling face with sunglasses')` Developer A
]

.pull-right.center[
`r ji('nerd')` Developer B
]
--
.pull-left.center[
- Scripting (lines 1-10) `r ji('computer')`
]

.pull-right.center[
- Scripting (lines 1-10) `r ji('computer')`
]
--
.pull-left.center[

- Scripting `r ji('computer')` / Coffee break `r ji('coffee')`                

]

.pull-right.center[

- Commits & pushes to Github `r ji('up arrow')`

]
--
.pull-left.center[

- Commits & tries to push to Github `r ji('up arrow')`   
(Forgot to pull, pulls after the fact)                

]

.pull-right.center[


]

--



.pull-left.center[

- receives `r ji('warning')`. Need to resolve conflict.             

]

.pull-right.center[


]

--

Committing/Pushing when not in-sync with the latest commits on Github creates the divergence. 



---

## Resolving Conflicts


Github embeds **.green[conflict dividers]** in the file. The `=======` line is the "center" of the conflict.

## Avoiding Conflicts

.panelset.sideways[

.panel[.panel-name[Github Desktop]

Notice the message indicating when there's new commits to the repo that require pulling

- Before working on your project, pull!

  - Click on `Fetch origin` button or 
  - Click the blue button in the middle of the screen 
]

.panel[.panel-name[Command Line]

If you're ready to add, commit, and push, but realized someone else has just pushed to the repo...

1. `git stash save` (removes the changes and sets them aside)

2. `git pull origin branch-name`

3. `git stash pop` (throw your changes back into the code)

4. `git add .`

5. `git commit -m 'your log message here'`

6. `git push origin branch-name`

]

## Pull Requests

- Notifying collaborators that you want to merge branches

- Creating a PR doesn't merge, just notifies and analyzes for conflicts 




---

## Fork

.panelset.sideways[
.panel[.panel-name[About]
> A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

- When the project diverges from the original intent

- A stepping-stone for your new project
