## Merge Conflicts

When do you encounter merge conflicts?

--
- When two people have changed the same lines in a file.

--


- Chances are higher for merge conflicts when 1) I'm changing the same lines in a file as someone else AND 2) forgetting to `git pull` (click on the `fetch origin` button) before changing a file and pushing.

--

Resolving conflicts


- Github embeds "conflict dividers" in the file. The `=======` line is the "center" of the conflict.

## Branches

.panel[.panel-name[Github Desktop]

- Click on `Branch` > `New Branch`

]

.panel[.panel-name[Command Line]

- `git checkout -b name-of-new-branch`

]
]


---

## Pull Requests

- Notifying collaborators that you want to merge branches

- Creating a PR doesn't merge, just notifies and analyzes for conflicts 




---

## Fork

> A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

- When the project diverges from the original intent

- A stepping-stone for your new project

- [Metropolitan Council (MN) forks PSRC's Travel Survey App](https://github.com/Metropolitan-Council/travel-study-stories)

## Undo-ing

.panelset.sideways[
.panel[.panel-name[Github Desktop]

]

.panel[.panel-name[Command Line]

- `Git reset HEAD dummy_file_01.R` (unstaging a file before a commit)

- `git checkout 36b761 dummy_file_01.R` (reverting a file to previous commit)

- `git checkout 36b761` (revert the whole repo to previous commit)
