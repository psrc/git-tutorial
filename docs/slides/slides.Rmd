## Merge Conflicts

When do you encounter merge conflicts?

--

**.green[When things diverge and two people have changed the same lines in a file.]**

--
.pull-left.center[
`r ji('smiling face with sunglasses')` Developer A
]

.pull-right.center[
`r ji('nerd')` Developer B
]
--
.pull-left.center[
- Scripting (lines 1-10) `r ji('computer')`
]

.pull-right.center[
- Scripting (lines 1-10) `r ji('computer')`
]
--
.pull-left.center[

- Scripting `r ji('computer')` / Coffee break `r ji('coffee')`                

]

.pull-right.center[

- Commits & pushes to Github `r ji('up arrow')`

]
--
.pull-left.center[

- Commits & tries to push to Github `r ji('up arrow')`   
(Forgot to pull and/or pulls after the fact)                

]

.pull-right.center[


]

--


Committing/Pushing when not in-sync with the latest commits on Github creates the divergence. 

--
.pull-left.center[

- receives `r ji('warning')`. Need to resolve conflict.             

]

.pull-right.center[

# How to Resolve a Conflict

---

## Resolving Conflicts


Github embeds **.green[conflict dividers]** in the file. The `=======` line is the "center" of the conflict. 

.mt5.center[
![](images/mc-resolve.png)
]

Keep the version you want (or create something new), but remember to remove the conflict divider and chevrons/labels before committing and pushing.

---

## Minimizing Conflicts

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width = "400px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/mc-tweet.png")
```

## Minimizing Conflicts

.panelset.sideways[

.panel[.panel-name[Github Desktop]

Notice the message indicating when there's new commits to the repo that require pulling

- Before working on your project, pull!

  - Click on the grey `Fetch origin`/`Pull origin` button or 
  - Click the blue button in the middle of the screen 
  
]

.panel[.panel-name[Command Line]

If you're ready to add, commit, and push, but realized someone else has just pushed to the repo...

1. `git stash save` (removes your changes and sets them aside)

2. `git pull origin branch-name`

3. `git stash pop` (throw your changes back into the code)

4. `git add .`

5. `git commit -m 'your log message here'`

6. `git push origin branch-name`

# Branching

## Branches

**.green[A version of the repo]** allows concurrent work on different parts of a project

## Benefits of Branches

- > Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository.

- Default branch: `main` (formerly k.a. `master`), can merge content of a branch with `main` or another branch within the repo

- Can have multiple branches

- Branches can be deleted

]

.panel[.panel-name[Command Line]

- `git checkout -b name-of-new-branch`
  - Creates a new branch and moves you onto the branch.

# Forking

## Fork

.panelset.sideways[
.panel[.panel-name[About]
> A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

- When the project diverges from the original intent

- A stepping-stone for your new project

]

.pull-right[
### Fork

]
]
